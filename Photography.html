        <h1>Analog SLRs</h1>
        <p>The two main cameras I use are the Nikon F-801 and the Canon A1, I am very much a fan of SLRs and enjoy both of these cameras for diffenet reasons, the Nikon is slighly older and has no auto focus, but its more mechanical feel really embodies the spirit of analog photography. On the other hand the newer Nikon is compatible with most older F type lenses and has auto focus. The canon is defintly more fun, but for anything where I have to get the shot, the Nikon is far more reliable.</p>
        <h1>Large Format</h1>
        <p>After lots of contemplation I eventually decided to purchase myself an Interpid 4x5. I have only used it a few times, and the only lens I have for it is currently broken, however I have to say, I have gratly enjoyed it so far, Here are some of the pictures I have taken with it:</p>
        <h1>Instant</h1>
        <p>I currently own 2 Polaroids, One newer Polaroid Now+ and an older Polaroid Land Camera 1000, both look similar, but there is a key distinction, The older one has no battery and relies on the internal battery of the SX-70 film, whilst this makes the film both more expensive and wastefull, it is far more practicle than the newer one which has to be charged regularly. I do however find myself using the newer camera more often, as the film for the older one is not often easily available where in stores where I live, and has to be ordered online. </p>
        <h1>Digital</h1>
        <p>The camera that I use the least but is ocasionally quite usefull, it's a 2008 Nikon D700 prevoiusly belonging to my father. At 12 megapixels, its by no means the latest and gratest, but it generally just works, and takes good enough pictures for me. </p>
