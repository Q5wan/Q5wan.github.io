        <p>After finding this 1958 Grundig 4088 radio in an old appartmnet, it sat around for quite some time as I was a bit scared to start working on it. I knew it would be a big project, but one of my professors convinced me to try and repair it, and so I did.
        <br><br>
        The radio would not turn on at all so I opened it up carefully and replaced all the internal capacitors, as they where most lickly all dried out. I replaced them all with ceramics, as these generally last forever. I also replaces some of the internal wires as the insulation was crumbling off. I tried plugging it in but no luck, after probing around my professor helped me find the issue, it was simply one capacitor that i had wired the wrong way round. After fixing this, the radio sprang to life and we where able to hear some stations, but there was still a lot of work to be done.

        I sanded and cleaned all the contacts of the vacume tubes, then i took apart all of the plastic pieces that where thourouly cleaned. After that I meticulously cleaned and lubricated every mechanical part of the radio, replaced the rubber on one of the clutches, fixed one of the broken cables that moved the vaistance, and replaced the front lightbulbs. 
        <br><br>
        One of the biggest jobs was getting the magic eye tube on the front working. instead of replacing with an original EM34, I decided to use a soviet copy called the 6E5C, as they are a lot cheaper, however it is not a drop in replacement, the pinout is not the same and the 6E5C has only a single anode as opposed to the EM34's two. <a href="https://www.radiomuseum.org/forum/replacing_the_em34_by_the_6e5c.html">Here</a> is a thread on how to correcly wire it up, and the resistance values also needed to be changed.

        After finishing the repair, i retorfitted it with a one of these <a href="https://www.digitec.ch/en/s1/product/tp-link-wrl-blueth-audio-receiver-receiver-bluetooth-audio-adapters-5832842?supplier=406802&campaignid=21028347594&adgroupid&adid&dgCidg=Cj0KCQjw4v6-BhDuARIsALprm322rmxuErj-Q-iNV7Qb6Bj0mHWpYKEg3HdnyIWDTgq5wQ7kAk6Rru0aAussEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1">TP-Link HA-100</a> bluetooth receivers, I had to modify the cable to make it a mono signal, and match the correct input impedance, I then drilled a small hole into the back of the radio and added a swtich, I hooked up the phono output to the swutch in such a way that when the switch is on the radio can play from bluetooth and when its off the phono is open for another device, this deos not impare the radios original functionality at all.
